#section[Introduction]
We decided to do a small reinforcement learning project.
As we have never done anything in terms of reinforcement learning before, we used this #link("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds&list=WL&index=26")[video] as a starting point. It is a tutorial of making a Snake game and create a reinforcement learning AI model which is able to play the game after some iterations.

#section[Tooling]
Like the guy in the tutorial we used Pytorch and Pygame to create everything.
